## Introduction

Welcome to the Movie Data Analysis and Prediction Project! This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing movie data to gain insights into various factors affecting movie success, such as ratings, votes, revenue, and more. Additionally, a machine learning model has been developed to predict the success of movies based on their attributes.


## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing using Python and Pandas.
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between movie attributes.
- Top directors and actors visualization.
- Trend analysis of ratings, votes, revenue, and metascore over the years.
- Machine learning model using Random Forest Classifier to predict movie success.

## Data Exploration and Visualization

The project includes various visualizations that help uncover insights from the movie dataset. These visualizations include pie charts for top directors and actors, line plots for trends over the years, a correlation heatmap, and more.

## Machine Learning

A machine learning model has been developed using the Random Forest Classifier to predict movie success based on attributes such as year, runtime, rating, genre, and more. The model's performance has been evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Dependencies

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie_sucess_predict.git
cd movie_sucess_predict
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Place your `movie_success_rate.csv` dataset file in the project directory.

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `Movie_Data_Analysis_Prediction.ipynb` to explore and analyze the data, visualize trends, and train the machine learning model.

3. Modify the code and visualizations as needed to suit your analysis goals.
